Developed an open data repository to support the Floresta Limpa project, aimed at improving wildfire prevention in Portugal through better monitoring of forest fuel breaks. The system is focused on spatiotemporal data received from multiple entities. The repository offers various APIs and other modular components, including the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) specification. Also implemented a data provenance system to ensure traceability and integrity of information. 
Technologies: Node.js (TypeScript), Python, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, RabbitMQ, Docker, Artillery
